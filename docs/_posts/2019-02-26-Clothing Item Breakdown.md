title: Clothing Item Breakdown
---

Let's look into the clothing items detected in the dataset, separated by genre. The following charts were created using the data found in the [last blog post](https://andrewkam.github.io/visual-aesthetics-classification/Balancing-the-Dataset/). They display top 10 detected items, regardless of each item's probability (which is included in the CNN image detection).
